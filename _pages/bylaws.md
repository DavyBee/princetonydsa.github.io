*Approved December 2022*

PREAMBLE
---
The Princeton Young Democratic Socialists of America proclaims that it has been founded to educate and organize students and young people in the Princeton community, and to play a helpful and principled role in advancing social justice. Throughout this struggle, we will defend the idea that true human liberation is impossible under capitalism, for which reason we seek democratic socialist change that expands democracy in the political, economic, and social realms and that builds the collective structures for students and working-class people to reach their full potential. Our vision of socialism is multitendency and profoundly democratic, feminist, anti-racist, and anti-capitalist.
