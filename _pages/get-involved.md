Check out [the chapter linktree](https://linktr.ee/princetonydsa) for our social media and relevant articles.

The bulk of our work comes from the working groups:

### Ecosocialist Working Group

We are organizing around resource extraction and public transit. The ultimate goal of the group is to help create a society that prioritizes the health of the planet, indigenous rights, efficient mass transit, and the well-being of all people over profit and corporate interests.

[Contact Martin](mailto:mmastnak@princeton.edu) to join the Ecosocialist WhatsApp group, where we discuss between meetings.

### Labor Working Group

Workers must sell their labor power to survive--it determines our relation to production, and is the primary battleground for improving working class conditions and changing the organization of production. We are currently working on campaigns related to building labor unions as a step toward dignity for workers and workplace democracy.

[Contact Bryce](mailto:brycespringfield@princeton.edu) to join the Labor WhatsApp group, where we discuss between meetings.

### Political Education Working Group

We bring in speakers like Sara Mughal of Starbucks Workers United, Noam Chomsky, and more. Interested in attending or having your own education event? Contact [Alan](mailto:ap3169@princeton.edu) or [Thomas](mailto:tc6305@princeton.edu)!
