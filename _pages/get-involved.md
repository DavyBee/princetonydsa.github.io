Want to get involved with Princeton YDSA? [Join us](https://my.princeton.edu/yds/club_signup) and attend our next general meeting! Contact yds@princeton.edu to join the GroupMe chat, where we discuss between meetings and have channels for each of the working groups.

The bulk of our work comes from the working groups:

### Ecosocialism

We are organizing around resource extraction and public transit. The ultimate goal of the group is to help create a society that prioritizes the health of the planet, indigenous rights, efficient mass transit, and the well-being of all people over profit and corporate interests.

### Labor

Workers must sell their labor power to survive--it determines our relation to production, and is the primary battleground for improving working class conditions and changing the organization of production. We are currently working on campaigns related to building labor unions as a step toward dignity for workers, with a longer-term goal toward ownership and democratic control of production by workers.

### Political Education

We bring in speakers like [Sara Mughal](https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2022/11/starbucks-organizer-sara-mughal-talks-unionization-ydsa-whig-clio-event) of Starbucks Workers United and [Noam Chomsky](https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2023/04/father-of-modern-linguistics-noam-chomsky-on-politics-and-power-student-activism-2023-princeton), alongside skill sharing and trainings to build organizing power and education.
