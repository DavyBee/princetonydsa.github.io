### Ecosocialist Working Group:

We are organizing around resource extraction and public transit. The ultimate goal of the group is to help create a society that prioritizes the health of the planet, indigenous rights, efficient mass transit, and the well-being of all people over profit and corporate interests.

* [Contact Martin](mailto:mmastnak@princeton.edu) to join the Ecosocialist WhatsApp group, where we discuss between meetings.

### Labor Working Group:

Workers must sell their labor power to survive--it determines our relation to production, and is the primary battleground for improving working class conditions and changing the organization of production. We are currently working on campaigns related to building labor unions as a step toward dignity for workers and workplace democracy.
